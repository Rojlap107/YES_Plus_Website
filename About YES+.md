# **How YES began?**

Launched in 1997 by the CTA as the Promotional Agency for Development of Micro Enterprises (PADME), the program transitioned to the Central Tibetan Relief Committee (CTRC) in 2003, evolving into Youth Empowerment Support (YES). 

Aimed at unemployed Tibetan youth, particularly school dropouts, YES offers skill training and start-up loans to help establish micro-enterprises, promoting youth employment and strengthening Tibetan community economies.

# **Transition from YES to YES+**

Originally focused on unemployed Tibetan youth and school dropouts, Youth Empowerment Support (YES) provided skills training and micro-enterprise support to strengthen community economies. Over time, it has evolved to address broader needs, fostering self-reliance and resilience among Tibetan youth.

As YES+, the program has expanded to serve all Tibetan youth, offering enhanced leadership, skills training, and entrepreneurship support. This broader scope fosters personal growth, employability, and cultural preservation, equipping Tibetan youth to thrive globally. YES+ also provides networking and mentorship opportunities, empowering participants to build meaningful careers while staying connected to their heritage.

# **Our Vision**

“YES+ envisions a self-reliant, empowered community of Tibetan youth who excel globally while honoring their cultural heritage.”

# **Our Mission**

Our mission is to equip Tibetan youth in exile with the skills, resources, and opportunities for personal and professional growth. We aim to foster a generation ready to lead, contribute to their communities, and preserve Tibetan identity. Through targeted programs in leadership, skills development, and entrepreneurship, YES+ enhances employability and promotes community engagement.
